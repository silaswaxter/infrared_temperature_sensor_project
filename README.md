# About

This project is for ECE413 at Oregon State University. The project is designed
to interact with a real sensor, in this case a temperature sensor (GY-906
MLX90614 Non-Contact IR). The task is to provide a readout of the sensor data to
a computer via a serial stream and to a mobile phone via bluetooth using an
ESP32 microcontroller and the Arduino framework.

## Programming

To get started follow this
[guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp32/), and select
the "ESP32 DEV Model" board.
